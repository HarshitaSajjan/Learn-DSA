stack is linera data structure
behaves like  box closed from one end
insertion = push
removal = pop

insert and remove from same end

stack operations

isEmpty(): return ture if stacl is empty else false
push(x): inserts an item to the top of the stack
pop(): removes an itemr from the top
peek(): return the top item
size(): return the size of the stack

stack s
s.push(20);
s.push(10);
s.push(30);
print(s.peek());
s.pop();
print(s.peek())
print(s.size())
s.push(5);
print(s.peek())
print(s.isempty());


two corner conditions
underflow: when pop() or peek() called on empty stack
overflow: when push called on full stack
