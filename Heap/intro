Binary Heap
used in heap sort
used to implement priority queue
priority queue is useful in many algorithms like
djisktra, shortest path, prims, haufmann
any situation where iteems in queue we use pq
eg: dr queue, pateintes prioortiy, highest priority is visited first

two types
    Min heap: highest priority item is assigned lowest priority
    Max heap: highest priority item is assigned highest priority

left(i)= 2i+1
right(i) = 2i+2
parent(i)=floor((i-1)/2)

complated binary tree
last level partially filled from left to right 
all level filled except possibly last level

adv: binary heap as an array
if cbt, no gaps in array and no space wastage
contiguos location , random access
cbt hegith is min poassible
most operation depend onheight of bt
linked dtaa stru then space is waste for storing ref  pointer


    min heap: cbt
                parent value<child value
                every node has value smaller than its descendants
