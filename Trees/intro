represent hierarchy
eg. organzation in data structure
folder structure4

array stack linked list queue -> linear, traverse from one side to other side, cant be used to represent hierarchy
these store in sequential structuree


tree -> non linear data structure
store in hierarchial structure

node
root
leaf
child
parent
subtree
descendants
ancestors
degree
internal nodes


tree -> recursive in nature

applications
to represent hierarchial data
eg organization structurefolder structure
xml/html content(JSONa object)->nesting of object
in OOP (Inheritance)

Binary Search Trees
Binary Heap->priority queues
B and B+ Trees in DBMS
Spanning and Shortest path trees in computer networks -> bridges-spanning trees, router ->shortest path tree
Parse tree, expression tree in compiler


Trie
Suffix Trees -> time is proportional to length of pattern
Binary Index Tree - fast
Segment Tree - powerful

tree-> used almost in every branch of computer science


Binary Tree
every node has at most two children ir degree of node is at most two
0,1,2 children
 three field in node
 left child pointr|key/data /value|right child pointer
